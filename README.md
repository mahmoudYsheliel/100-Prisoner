##  What is the 100 Prisoners Problem?

- 100 prisoners are each given a number from 1 to 100.
- Each prisoner can open 50 boxes to try to find their own number.
- If **every prisoner** finds their number, they all win.
- If **one prisoner fails**, they all lose.

There is a smart strategy (not just random guessing) that gives a **30% chance of winning**!
